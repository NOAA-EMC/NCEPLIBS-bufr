C> THIS SUBROUTINE IS CALLED BY BUFR ARCHIVE LIBRARY SUBROUTINE
C>   UFBRW WHENEVER IT CAN'T FIND A MNEMONIC IT WANTS TO WRITE WITHIN THE
C>   CURRENT SUBSET BUFFER.  IT LOOKS FOR THE MNEMONIC WITHIN ANY
C>   UNEXPANDED "DRS" (STACK) OR "DRB" (1-BIT DELAYED REPLICATION)
C>   SEQUENCES INSIDE OF THE PORTION OF THE SUBSET BUFFER BOUNDED BY THE
C>   INDICES INV1 AND INV2.  IF FOUND, IT EXPANDS THE APPLICABLE "DRS" OR
C>   "DRB" SEQUENCE TO THE POINT WHERE THE MNEMONIC IN QUESTION NOW
C>   APPEARS IN THE SUBSET BUFFER, AND IN DOING SO IT WILL ALSO RETURN
C>   A NEW VALUE FOR INV2.

C> 1994-01-06  J. WOOLLEN -- ORIGINAL AUTHOR
C> 1998-07-08  J. WOOLLEN -- REPLACED CALL TO CRAY LIBRARY ROUTINE
C>                           "ABORT" WITH CALL TO NEW INTERNAL BUFRLIB
C>                           ROUTINE "BORT" (LATER REMOVED, UNKNOWN
C>                           WHEN)
C> 2002-05-14  J. WOOLLEN -- REMOVED OLD CRAY COMPILER DIRECTIVES
C> 2003-11-04  S. BENDER  -- ADDED REMARKS/BUFRLIB ROUTINE
C>                           INTERDEPENDENCIES
C> 2003-11-04  D. KEYSER  -- MAXJL (MAXIMUM NUMBER OF JUMP/LINK ENTRIES)
C>                           INCREASED FROM 15000 TO 16000 (WAS IN

C> USAGE:    CALL DRSTPL (INOD, LUN, INV1, INV2, INVN)
C>
C>   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C>     INOD     - INTEGER: JUMP/LINK TABLE INDEX OF MNEMONIC TO LOOK FOR 
C>     LUN      - INTEGER: I/O STREAM INDEX INTO INTERNAL MEMORY ARRAYS
C>     INV1     - INTEGER: STARTING INDEX OF THE PORTION OF THE SUBSET
C>                BUFFER CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED BY UFBRW
C>     INV2     - INTEGER: ENDING INDEX OF THE PORTION OF THE SUBSET
C>                BUFFER CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED BY UFBRW
C>
C>   OUTPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
C>     INVN     - INTEGER: LOCATION INDEX OF INOD WITHIN SUBSET BUFFER:
C>                  0 = NOT FOUND
C>     INV2     - INTEGER: IF INVN = 0, THEN INV2 IS UNCHANGED FROM ITS
C>                INPUT VALUE.  OTHERWISE, IT CONTAINS THE REDEFINED
C>                ENDING INDEX OF THE PORTION OF THE SUBSET BUFFER
C>                CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED BY UFBRW, SINCE EXPANDING A
C>                DELAYED REPLICATION SEQUENCE WILL HAVE NECESSARILY
C>                INCREASED THE SIZE OF THIS BUFFER.
