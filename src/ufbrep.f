C> @brief Read/write one or more data values from/to a data subset.

C> This subroutine reads or writes one or more data values from or to
C> the BUFR data subset that is currently open within the BUFRLIB
C> internal arrays.  The direction of the data transfer is determined
C> by the context of ABS(LUNIN):
C> - If ABS(LUNIN) points to a file that was previously opened for
C>   input using subroutine openbf(), then data values are read from
C>   the current data subset.
C> - If ABS(LUNIN) points to a file that was previously opened for
C>   output using subroutine openbf(), then data values are written to
C>   the current data subset.
C>
C> <p>This subroutine is specifically designed for use with Table B
C> mnemonics which are part of a fixed (i.e. non-delayed) replication
C> sequence, or for mnemonics which are replicated by being directly
C> listed more than once within an overall subset definition.
C> See also subroutines ufbint(),
C> ufbseq() and ufbstp(), which can also be used to read/write one or
C> more data values from/to a data subset but are designed for
C> different use cases.  A more detailed discussion of
C> these different use cases, including examples, is available in
C> [DX BUFR Tables](@ref ufbsubs).

C> @param[in] STR - character*(*): String of blank-separated
C>                  Table B mnemonics
C>                  in one-to-one correspondence with the number of data
C>                  values that will be read/written from/to the data
C>                  subset within the first dimension of USR (see
C>                  [DX BUFR Tables](@ref dfbftab) for further
C>                  information about Table B mnemonics)
C>
C> <p>It is the user's responsibility to ensure that USR is dimensioned
C> sufficiently large enough to accommodate the number of data values
C> that are to be read from or written to the data subset.  Note also
C> that USR is an array of real*8 values; therefore, any data that are
C> to be written out as character (i.e. CCITT IA5) values in
C> BUFR must be converted from character into real*8 format within the
C> application program before calling this subroutine.  Conversely,
C> when this subroutine is being used to read character values from a
C> data subset, the value that is returned will be in real*8 format
C> and must be converted back into character format by the application
C> program before it can be used as such.  Alternatively, there are
C> different subroutines such as readlc() and writlc() which can be
C> used to read/write character data directly from/to a data subset
C> without the need to convert from/to real*8 format as an intermediate
C> step.
C>
C> <p>Numeric (i.e. non-character) data values within USR are always in
C> the exact units specified for the corresponding mnemonic within the
C> relevant DX or master BUFR table, without any scale or reference
C> values applied.  Specifically, this means that, when writing
C> data values into an output subset, the user only needs to store each
C> respective value into USR using the units specified within the table,
C> and the BUFRLIB software will take care of any necessary scaling or
C> referencing of the value before it is actually encoded into BUFR.
C> Conversely, when reading data values from an input subset, the
C> values returned in USR are already de-scaled and de-referenced and,
C> thus, are already in the exact units that were defined for the
C> corresponding mnemonics within the table.
C>
C> <p>"Missing" values in USR are always denoted by a unique
C> placeholder value.  This placeholder value is initially set
C> to a default value of 10E10 via an internal call to subroutine
C> bfrini(), but it can be reset to
C> any substitute value of the user's choice via a separate
C> call to subroutine setbmiss().  In any case, and whenever this
C> subroutine is used to read data values from an input subset, any
C> returned value in USR can be easily checked for equivalence to the
C> current placeholder value via a call to function ibfms(), and a
C> positive result means that the value for the corresponding mnemonic
C> was encoded as "missing" in BUFR (i.e. all bits set to 1) within the
C> original data subset.  Conversely, whenever this subroutine
C> is used to write data values to an output subset, the current
C> placeholder value can be obtained via a separate call to function
C> getbmiss(), and the resulting value can then be stored into the
C> USR array whereever the user desires a BUFR "missing" value (i.e.
C> all bits set to 1) to be encoded for the corresponding mnemonic
C> within the output subset.
C>
C> @remarks
C> - If LUNIN < 0, and if ABS(LUNIN) points to a file that is open
C> for output (writing BUFR), then the subroutine will treat the file
C> pointed to by ABS(LUNIN) as though it was open for input (reading
C> BUFR).  This is a special capability for use by some applications
C> that need to read certain values back out from a BUFR file during
C> the same time that it is in the process of being written to.
C> - If ABS(LUNIN) points to a file that is open for input (reading
C> BUFR), there are a few additional special mnemonics that can be
C> included within STR when calling this subroutine, and which in turn
C> will result in special information being returned within the
C> corresponding location in USR.  These special mnemonics are not
C> considered to be part of Table B or Table D and therefore do not
C> need to be definied within the DX or master table file associated
C> with ABS(LUNIN):
C>      - NUL - returns the "missing" value
C>      - IREC - returns the number of the BUFR message within the
C>               file pointed to by ABS(LUNIN) (counting from the
C>               beginning of the file) in which the current data
C>               subset resides
C>      - ISUB - returns the number of the current data subset within
C>               the BUFR message pointed to by IREC, counting from
C>               the beginning of the message
