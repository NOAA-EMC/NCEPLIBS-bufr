C> Initialize replication factors for delayed replication sequences.
C>
C> This subroutine explicitly initializes delayed replication factors
C> and allocates a corresponding amount of space within internal arrays,
C> thereby allowing the subsequent use of subroutine ufbseq() to write
C> data into delayed replication sequences.

C>                    in one-to-one correspondence with the number
C>                    of occurrences of DRFTAG within the overall
C>                    subset definition, and explicitly defining
C>                    how much space (i.e. how many replications)
C>                    to allocate within each successive occurrence

C> Logical unit LUNIT should have already been opened for output
C> operations (i.e. writing/encoding BUFR) via a previous call to
C> subroutine openbf(), and a message for output should have already

C> The use of this subroutine is only required when writing data
C> into delayed replication sequences using ufbseq(), or for cases
C> where ufbint() or ufbrep() are being used to write data into
C> delayed replication sequences which occur more than once within
C> an overall subset definition.  In such cases, the use of this
C> subroutine allows the application code to explicitly specify how
C> many replications of the sequence are to be allocated to each
C> occurrence of the delayed replication sequence within the overall
C> subset definition, prior to storing all of the actual data values
C> themselves via a single subsequent call to ufbint() or ufbrep().
C> In contrast, the use of this subroutine is not required when
C> ufbint() or ufbrep() are to be called to store data values
C> for a delayed replication sequence which only occurs one time
C> within an overall subset definition, because in that case the
C> same type of initialization and space allocation functionality
C> will be automatically handled internally within subroutine
C> ufbint() or ufbrep().
