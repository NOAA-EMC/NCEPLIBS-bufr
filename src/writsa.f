C> Write a data subset into a BUFR message, and return each
C> completed message within a memory array.
C>
C> This subroutine is similar to subroutine writsb(), except that in
C> addition to writing each completed message to a specified Fortran
C> logical unit, it also returns a copy of each completed message to
C> the application program within a memory array.
C>
C> This subroutine is called to indicate that
C> all necessary values for a data subset (i.e. report) have been written,
C> and the subset is ready to be encoded and packed into the
C> current message for the BUFR file associated with logical unit
C> ABS(LUNXX). Logical unit ABS(LUNXX) should have already been opened
C> for output operations via a previous call to subroutine openbf(),
C> and a BUFR message should already be open for output within internal
C> arrays via a previous call to one of the BUFRLIB
C> [message-writing subroutines](@ref hierarchy).
C> All of the values for the data subset should have
C> already been written into internal arrays via calls to any of the
C> BUFRLIB [values-writing subroutines](@ref hierarchy)
C>
C> This subroutine returns a copy of each completed
C> BUFR message to the application program within a memory array.
C> When using this subroutine, it is important to note that the BUFRLIB
C> software is designed to pack as many data subsets as possible into
C> each message for output, and therefore not every call to this
C> subroutine will result in a message being returned in MSGT. In
C> such cases, MSGL will contain the value 0, indicating that no
C> message was returned.
C>
C> Only when MSGL contains a value
C> greater than 0 is there an actual BUFR message within MSGT; otherwise,
C> the message into which the data subset was packed remains internally
C> within BUFRLIB so that future data subsets can be packed into it as
C> well, and the message will eventually be returned during some other
C> future call to this subroutine. For this reason, there is a way to
C> force the subroutine to return any message contained within the
C> internal BUFRLIB arrays, such as when there are no more data subsets
C> to be encoded and we're ready to exit the application program. In
C> this case, the application program should make one final call to
C> this subroutine, but with LUNXX set to a negative value;
C> specifically, to the additive inverse of the Fortran logical unit
C> number of the BUFR file. This signals to the subroutine that there
C> are no more data subsets to be packed into the current message for
C> logical unit ABS(LUNXX), and that the existing message should
C> instead be immediately flushed to output and returned in MSGT.
C>
C> @remarks
C> - There is a maximum size for any BUFR message that can be written
C> by the BUFRLIB software. This maximum message size is initially set
C> to an internal default value within subroutine bfrini(), but it can
C> be changed to a different value via a separate prior call to
C> subroutine maxout().
C> - As is the case for subroutine writsb(), this subroutine will also
C> check to ensure that the data subset, when encoded and packed, will
C> fit into the current BUFR message that is open within the internal
C> arrays associated with logical unit ABS(LUNXX).  If adding the data
C> subset to the current message would cause the maximum message size
C> to be exceeded, then the subroutine will automatically flush the
C> current message to logical unit ABS(LUNXX) and to array MSGT, then
C> open and initialize a new internal message using the same SUBSET and
C> JDATE values that were specified in the most recent call to one of
C> the [message-writing subroutines](@ref hierarchy) for ABS(LUNXX),
C> then encode and pack the data subset into that new message.
C> - If the user would prefer that output messages only be returned
C> to the calling program via the MSGT memory array and not also
C> written to Fortran logical unit ABS(LUNXX), then this can be
C> accomplished by setting IO = 'NUL' when calling subroutine openbf()
C> for ABS(LUNXX). In such cases, the logical unit number ABS(LUNXX)
C> does not even need to be associated with an actual file on the
C> local system.
C>
C> @param[in] LUNXX - integer: Absolute value is Fortran logical unit
C> number for BUFR file.
C> @param[in] LMSGT - integer: Dimensioned size (in integers) of MSGT;
C> used by the subroutine to ensure that it doesn't overflow the MSGT
C> array.
C> @param[out] MSGT - integer: BUFR message.
C> @param[out] MSGL - integer: Size (in integers) of BUFR message in
C> MSGT (0 for no message).
