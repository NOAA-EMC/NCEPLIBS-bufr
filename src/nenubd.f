C> THIS SUBROUTINE CHECKS A MNEMONIC AND FXY VALUE PAIR THAT
C>   WERE READ FROM A USER-SUPPLIED BUFR DICTIONARY TABLE IN CHARACTER
C>   FORMAT, IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT NEITHER VALUE HAS ALREADY BEEN
C>   DEFINED WITHIN INTERNAL BUFR TABLE B OR D (IN MODULE TABABD) FOR
C>   THE GIVEN LUN.  IF EITHER VALUE HAS ALREADY BEEN DEFINED FOR THIS
C>   LUN, THEN AN APPROPRIATE CALL IS MADE TO BUFR ARCHIVE LIBRARY
C>   SUBROUTINE BORT.

C> PROGRAM HISTORY LOG:
C> 1994-01-06  J. WOOLLEN -- ORIGINAL AUTHOR (ENTRY POINT IN NENUCK)
C> 1995-06-28  J. WOOLLEN -- INCREASED THE SIZE OF INTERNAL BUFR TABLE
C>                           ARRAYS IN ORDER TO HANDLE BIGGER FILES
C> 1998-07-08  J. WOOLLEN -- REPLACED CALL TO CRAY LIBRARY ROUTINE
C>                           "ABORT" WITH CALL TO NEW INTERNAL BUFRLIB
C>                           ROUTINE "BORT" (IN PARENT ROUTINE NENUCK)
C> 1999-11-18  J. WOOLLEN -- THE NUMBER OF BUFR FILES WHICH CAN BE
C>                           OPENED AT ONE TIME INCREASED FROM 10 TO 32
C>                           (NECESSARY IN ORDER TO PROCESS MULTIPLE
C>                           BUFR FILES UNDER THE MPI) (IN PARENT
C>                           ROUTINE NENUCK)
C> 2002-05-14  J. WOOLLEN -- CHANGED FROM AN ENTRY POINT TO INCREASE
C>                           PORTABILITY TO OTHER PLATFORMS (NENUCK WAS
C>                           THEN REMOVED BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A DUMMY
C>                           ROUTINE WITH ENTRIES)
C> 2003-11-04  J. ATOR    -- ADDED DOCUMENTATION
C> 2003-11-04  S. BENDER  -- ADDED REMARKS/BUFRLIB ROUTINE
C>                           INTERDEPENDENCIES
C> 2003-11-04  D. KEYSER  -- UNIFIED/PORTABLE FOR WRF; ADDED HISTORY
C>                           DOCUMENTATION; OUTPUTS MORE COMPLETE
C>                           DIAGNOSTIC INFO WHEN ROUTINE TERMINATES
C>                           ABNORMALLY
C> 2014-12-10  J. ATOR    -- USE MODULES INSTEAD OF COMMON BLOCKS

C> USAGE:    CALL NENUBD (NEMO, NUMB, LUN)
C>   INPUT ARGUMENT LIST:
