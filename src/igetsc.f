C> @author J. Ator @date 2010-05-11

C> This function returns a status code associated with any file that
C> was previously opened via a call to subroutine openbf(), so that
C> the application program can check whether the BUFRLIB software
C> encountered any specific problems while processing the file.
C>
C> @param[in] LUNIT -- integer: Fortran logical unit number for
C>                         BUFR file
C> @returns igetsc -- integer:
C>                     -  0 = no problems were encountered
C>
C> @remarks
C> - Once subroutine openbf() has been called for LUNIT, this function
C> can then be called any number of times and at any point throughout
C> the remainder of the life of the application program.  However, it
C> is most typically called immediately prior to exiting an application
C> program.

C     Check for I8 integers.

      IF (IM8B) THEN
        IM8B = .FALSE.

        CALL X84(LUNIT,MY_LUNIT,1)
        IRET = IGETSC(MY_LUNIT)

        IM8B = .TRUE.
        RETURN
      END IF

      IRET = 0

C     Make sure the specified logical unit is connected to the library.

      CALL STATUS(LUNIT,LUN,IL,IM)
      IF(IL.EQ.0) GOTO 900

      IRET = ISCODES(LUN)

      RETURN
 900  CALL BORT('BUFRLIB: IGETSC - BUFR FILE IS CLOSED, IT MUST BE'//
     . ' OPEN')
      END
