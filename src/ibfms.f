C> @brief Test whether a real*8 data value is "missing"

C> This function provides a handy way to check whether a real*8
C> data value returned from a previous call to any of the
C> subroutines ufbint(), ufbrep(), ufbseq(), ufbtab(), etc
C> contains the current placeholder value for "missing" data.

C> @param[in] R8VAL - real*8: Data value to be tested
C>
C> @returns ibfms  -  integer:
C>                    - 0 = R8VAL is not "missing"
C>                    - 1 = R8VAL is "missing"
C>
C> <p>The current placeholder value for "missing" data
C> is always equal to the value XMISS as specified during the
C> most recent call to subroutine setbmiss(), or to a default
C> value of 10E10 if setbmiss() was never called.  In either
C> case, a return value of 1 means that the corresponding
C> value was encoded as "missing" (all bits set to 1)
C> within the actual BUFR data subset.
C>
C> @remarks
C> - The use of an integer return code allows this function
C> to be called in a logical context from application programs
C> written in C as well as in Fortran.
