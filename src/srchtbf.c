/**
 *  This subroutine searches for a specified FXY number and associated
 *  value (code figure or bit number) within the internal memory
 *  structure for storage of master Code/Flag table entries, and if
 *  found returns the associated meaning as a character string.
 *
 *  The search may optionally include a specified second FXY number
 *  and associated value upon which the first FXY number and its
 *  associated value depend, for example when the meaning of an
 *  originating sub-center value depends on the identity of the
 *  originating center for which the sub-center in question is a
 *  member.
 *
 *  @param[in] ifxyi -- f77int*: Bit-wise representation of FXY number
 *                      to search for
 *  @param[in] ivali -- f77int*: Value (code figure or bit number)
 *                      associated with ifxyi
 *  @param[in,out] ifxyd -- f77int*:
 *                          - On input, ifxyd[0] is set to
 *                            the bit-wise representation of the FXY
 *                            number upon which ifxyi and ivali depend,
 *                            or else set to (-1) if ifxyi and ivali do
 *                            not depend on the value associated with
 *                            any other FXY number
 *                          - On output, if the initial search of the
 *                            master Code/Flag table was unsuccessful,
 *                            <b>and</b> if ifxyd[0] and ivald were both
 *                            set to (-1) on input, <b>and</b> if a
 *                            second search of the table determines that
 *                            the meaning of ifxyi and ivali indeed
 *                            depends on one or more other FXY numbers,
 *                            then the bit-wise representations of those
 *                            FXY numbers are returned within the first
 *                            iret elements of ifxyd
 *  @param[in] ivald -- f77int*: Value (code figure or bit number)
 *                      associated with the FXY number in ifxyd[0]; set
 *                      to (-1) whenever ifxyd[0] is also set to (-1)
 *  @param[in] mxfxyd -- f77int*: Number of elements in ifxyd array;
 *                       used by the subroutine to ensure that
 *                       it doesn't overflow the array.
 *  @param[in] mxmng -- f77int*: Number of elements in meaning
 *                      array; used by the subroutine to ensure that
 *                      it doesn't overflow the string.
 *  @param[out] meaning -- char*: Meaning corresponding to ifxyi and
 *                         ivali (and to ifxyd[0] and ivald, if
 *                         specified on input)
 *  @param[out] lnmng -- f77int*: Length (in bytes) of string returned
 *                       in CMEANG
 *  @param[out] iret -- f77int*: return code
 *                      -  0 = meaning found and stored in meaning string
 *                      - -1 = meaning not found
 *                      - >0 = meaning not found, <b>and</b> ifxyd[0] and
 *                             ivald were both set to (-1) on input,
 *                             <b>and</b> the meaning of ifxyi and ivali
 *                             depends on the the value associated with
 *                             one of the FXY numbers whose bit-wise
 *                             representation is stored in the first iret
 *                             elements of ifxyd
