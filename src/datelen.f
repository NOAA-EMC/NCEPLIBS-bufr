C> This subroutine is used to specify the format of Section 1
C> date-time values that will be output by future calls to
C> any of the BUFRLIB subroutines which read BUFR messages,

C>                    values to be output by all future calls
C>                    to readmg(), readerme(), etc.
C>                    -  8 = YYMMDDHH format with 2-digit year
C>                           (the default)
C>                    - 10 = YYYYMMDDHH format with 4-digit year

C> <p>This subroutine can be called at any time from within the
C> application program, and the specified value for LEN will remain
C> in effect for all future calls to any of the BUFRLIB subroutines
C> which read BUFR messages, unless a subsequent call is made to this
C> subroutine to reset the value of LEN again.  If this subroutine is
C> never called, a default value of 8 is used for LEN, as set within
C> subroutine bfrini().
