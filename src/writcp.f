C> This subroutine is similar to subroutine writsb(), except that
C> when the subset is encoded and packed into the current message
C> for the BUFR file associated with logical unit LUNIT, it is
C> packed using compression as prescribed within the
C> [official WMO BUFR regulations](@ref manual).
C>
C> This subroutine activates compression via an internal call to
C> subroutine cmpmsg(), followed by an internal call to subroutine
C> writsb(), followed by a second internal call to subroutine
C> cmpmsg() to deactivate compression.  For this reason, most
C> application programs which write compressed BUFR messages now
C> call subroutines cmpmsg() and writsb() directly; however, this
C> subroutine is still supported within the BUFRLIB software for
C> backwards-compatibility with certain legacy application programs.
