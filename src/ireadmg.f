C> Calls NCEPLIBS-bufr subroutine readmg() and passes

C>
C> The use of this function allows the return code from readmg() to be
C> used as the target variable within an iterative program loop.

C> @param[in] LUNIT - integer: Fortran logical unit number for BUFR file
C> @param[out] SUBSET - character*8: Table A mnemonic for type of BUFR
C> message that was read (see [DX BUFR Tables](@ref dfbftab)
C> for further information about Table A mnemonics)
C> @param[out] IDATE - integer: date-time stored within Section 1 of
C> BUFR message that was read, in format of either YYMMDDHH or YYYYMMDDHH,
C> depending on the most recent call to subroutine datelen()
C> @returns ireadmg - integer: Return code:
C> - 0 = new BUFR message was successfully read into internal arrays
C> - -1 = there are no more BUFR messages in the file connected to logical
