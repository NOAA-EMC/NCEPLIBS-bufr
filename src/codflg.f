C> <p>See [Master BUFR Tables](@ref dfbfmstab)
C> for more information about master BUFR tables.  In particlar, note
C> that Table B and Table D files are always read whenever master BUFR
C> tables are being used, but the reading of Code/Flag table files is
C> optional and should only be included if the user intends to make
C> one or more future calls to subroutine getcfmng(); otherwise, the
C> reading of Code/Flag table files will result in the unnecessary use
C> of memory and other system resources.
C>
C> <p>If Code/Flag tables are to be read and used, they must reside in
C> the same directory as the master Table B and Table D files on the
C> local filesystem, as specified within a separate call to
C> subroutine mtinfo().
C>
C> <p>This subroutine can be called at any time after the first call
C> to subroutine openbf(), and the specified value for CF will remain
C> in effect for all future reads of master BUFR tables, unless a
C> subsequent call is made to this subroutine to reset the value of
C> CF again.  If this subroutine is never called, a default value of
C> 'N' is used for CF, as set within subroutine bfrini().
