 *                      for which ival is a defined code or flag
 *                      table entry
 *  @param[in] ival  -- f77int*: Code figure or bit number
 *  @param[in] meaning -- char*: Meaning associated with ifxyn and ival
 *  @param[in] lmeaning -- f77int*: Length (in bytes) of meaning
 *  @param[in] idfxy -- f77int*: Bit-wise representation of FXY number
 *                      upon which ifxyn and ival depend (if any), or

 *                      (if any), or else set to (-1) whenever idfxy is
 *                      also set to (-1)
