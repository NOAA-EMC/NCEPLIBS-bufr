C> library, or change verbosity associated with already-connected file.

C> This subroutine connects a new file to the BUFRLIB software for
C> input or output operations, or initializes the library without
C> connecting to a file, or changes the verbosity of the library for an
C> already-connected BUFR file.
C>
C> The logical unit numbers LUNIT and LUNDX must already be associated
C> with actual filenames on the local system, typically via a Fortran "OPEN"
C> statement. Multiple logical units can be connected to the BUFRLIB software
C> at any one time.
C>
C> The argument IO is a character string describing how the file connected to
C> LUNIT will be used, e.g. 'IN' is used to access an existing file of BUFR
C> messages for input (i.e. reading/decoding BUFR), and 'OUT' is used to access
C> a new file for output (i.e. writing/encoding BUFR). An option 'APX' is also
C> available which behaves like 'OUT', except that output is then appended to
C> an existing BUFR file rather than creating a new one from scratch, and there
C> are also some additional options 'NUL' and 'NODX' which can likewise be used
C> instead of 'OUT' for some very special cases as needed. There's also an
C> option 'SEC3' which can be used in place of 'IN' for certain cases when the
C> user is attempting to read BUFR messages whose content and descriptor layout
C> are unknown in advance. However, all of these additional options are
C> basically just variations of 'IN' or 'OUT', again depending on whether the
C> intent is to read or write BUFR messages from the file connected to LUNIT.
C> The only exceptions are when IO = 'FIRST' or 'QUIET'.  When IO = 'FIRST',
C> the subroutine simply checks whether it has already been called from within
C> the application program and, if not, goes ahead and initializes the library
C> without actually connecting any files in LUNIT or LUNDX.
C>
C> Alternatively, when IO = 'QUIET', the subroutine simply sets or resets the
C> internal print verbosity switch to the value of input argument LUNDX,
C> overriding its previous value and/or its internal default value of 0.
C>
C> The third and final call argument LUNDX identifies the logical unit which
C> contains the definition of the DX BUFR tables to be associated with unit
C> LUNIT.  Except when IO = 'SEC3', every BUFR file that is linked to the BUFRLIB
C> software must have a DX BUFR tables file associated with it, and these tables
C> may be defined within a separate ASCII text file
C> (see [Description and Format of DX BUFR Tables](@ref dfbftab) for more info.)
C> or, in the case of an existing BUFR file, may be embedded within the first few
C> BUFR messages of the file itself, and in which case the user can denote this
C> to the subroutine by setting LUNDX to the same value as LUBFR.
C>
C> @remarks
C> - When an existing BUFR file is accessed for input (i.e. reading/decoding BUFR),
C> the associated DX BUFR tables defined by LUNDX are stored internally within
C> the BUFRLIB software and are referenced during all subsequent processing of
C> the file. Likewise, when a file is accessed for output (i.e. writing/encoding
C> BUFR), the associated DX BUFR tables are still stored internally for subsequent
C> reference; however, the output file itself is also initialized by writing the
C> BUFR table information (as one or more BUFR messages) to the beginning of the
C> file, except when IO = 'NODX', and in which case the writing of these
C> additional messages is suppressed.
C> - As noted above, 'SEC3' is the only value of IO (other than 'QUIET') where it's
C> not necessary to provide pre-defined DX BUFR tables via LUNDX.  Instead, this
C> option instructs the BUFRLIB software to unpack the data description section
C> (Section 3) from each BUFR message it reads and then decode the contents
C> accordingly. In this case, it's necessary to provide a set of BUFR master
C> tables containing listings of all possible BUFR descriptors
C> (see [Description and Format of master BUFR Tables](@ref dfbfmstab) for more
C> info.), but otherwise no prior knowledge is required of the contents of the
C> messages to be decoded.

C>                       file (unless IO is set to 'FIRST' or 'QUIET', in
C>                       which case this is a dummy argument)
C> @param[in] IO      -- character*(*): flag indicating how LUNIT is to be
C>                       used by the software:

C>                 -   'INX' = input operations w/o table processing
C>                 -   'OUX' = output operations w/o table processing
C>                 -   'OUT' = output operations with table processing
C>                 -  'SEC3' = same as 'IN', except use Section 3 of input
C>                              messages for decoding rather than DX BUFR
C>                              table information from LUNDX; in this case
C>                              LUNDX is ignored, and user must provide
C>                              appropriate [master BUFR tables](@ref dfbfmstab)
C>                              within the directory specified by a subsequent
